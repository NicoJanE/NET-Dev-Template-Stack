# CLASS LIBRARY (DLL)
# Creates a reusable code library that can be shared across multiple projects.
# Use for: Business logic, utilities, NuGet packages, shared components
# Output: Creates .dll file that works on both Linux and Windows (.NET cross-platform)
# Tech: Compiled library, no executable - referenced by other projects
# Note: Essential building block for larger applications and code reuse
